# Crypto Trading
In this repository we will try several cryptocurrencies algorithmic trading strategies. All this strategies are real time ones but without sending the trades to an exchange*. There is an option to set a telgram bot to send you messages to your Telegram account for trades executed and equity balance information. 

The different strategies tried are:

* Momentum
* Statistical Arbitrage

## Momentum algo:
trend_follow_algo.py

## Statistical Arbitrage algo:
stat_arb.py




*NOTE: If you want to make them to work live you will need to write the functions to send those trades to the exchange instead of sending the messages to your Telegram bot.
